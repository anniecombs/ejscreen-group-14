```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(here)
```

Add a new code chunk to create a basic ggplot2 scatterplot graph (with geom_point) showing % white (x-axis: white_percent, note: depending on your OS this column name might be simplified by janitor::clean_names() to just ‘white’ instead) versus CalEnviroScreen pollution burden score (y-axis: ces_3_0_score). Do not update / finalize the graph further - this is what you will both work on in the next steps. 

### Read In Data 
```{r}
ces <- read_csv(here("data", "ces3demographics.csv")) %>% 
  clean_names() #convert column names to lower_snake_case
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = ces) +
  geom_point(aes( x = white_percent, y = ces_3_0_score))
```
